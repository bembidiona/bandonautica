## HOW TO USE

### BANDONAUT MODE

* pressing the NEXT button will start retrieving a new track
* About the tag filter input field:
	- if leaved as 'tag filter' or empty, the randonauting will happen in the WHOLE site of bandcamp. This way, any playable track in the site can be reached by random.
	- If you put a tag as "vaporwave" (without quotation marks), only tracks from albums tagged as that can be retrieved while randonauting.
	- Input one tag only per search. "comfy synth" for example, while having two words, is still valid because is ONE whole tag
	- SCROLL_TIME in the config.ini, change how much time is available for 'going deeper' when searching with a specified tag for the first time. The more SCROLL_TIME, it will not only retrieve more albums, but also increasingly more obscure releases!



### DOWNLOADER MODE 
1- Just paste URLs of the albums you wish to download. Some examples of valid URLs are:
```

##### AUTOPLAY:
If enabled, when the currently playing track ends, a new randonaut search will be automatically start and a new track will be retrieved.
##### QUANTUM RANDOM:
If enabled, random numbers will be 'true-random'. These are generated by the Quantum Random Number Generator provided by the Australian National University.
If disabled, or the QRNG site is down, random will fall back to generated by the random python library.
##### SCROBBLE:
This feature is only for users of last.fm
If enabled, the track will scrobble at playing the 75% of its length

## KNOW ISSUES AND OTHER NOTES
* For filtering by tag, it is needed having Chrome installed.
Bandonautica ship with chromedriver version 84. If you encounter problems using this mode, download the correct version for your Chrome installation from here https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads, and add it to the path in the config.ini.
* The first time searching with a specified tag can take some time. But after that is way faster that randonauting in the complete bandcamp site
* Waiting the sites respond the requests can take some time, making the GUI unresponsive. Try to don't fiddle with the GUI when a search or downloads is in progress.
* Crashes are expected. Check the log.txt file for a list of the tracks listened and hints of what can be gone wrong.
