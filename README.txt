				   ABOUT
---------------------------------------------
Simply put it's a true random radio using the whole bandcamp site as a database.
Born out of the necessity of escaping the Newtonian music bubble!
It also comes with a handy album downloader, auto tagging and scrobbling features.
---------------------------------------------
				INSTRUCCIONS
---------------------------------------------

### BANDONAUT MODE ###
1- Press START button to start retrieving a new track.
2- Wait... The first time this can take some time.
3- When the process is done, the retrieved track will be start playing automatically!

* you can pause a playing track with the PAUSE button
* you can go to the bandcamp page of the album with the URL button
* pressing the NEXT button will start retrieving a new track
* About the tag filter input field:
	- if leaved as 'tag filter' or empty, the randonauting will happen in the WHOLE site of bandcamp. This way, any playable track in the site can be reached by random.
	- If you put a tag as "vaporwave" (without quotation marks), only tracks from albums tagged as that can be retrieved while randonauting.
	- Input one tag only per search. "comfy synth" for example, while having two words, is still valid because is ONE whole tag
	- SCROLL_TIME in the config.ini, change how much time is available for 'going deeper' when searching with a specified tag for the first time. The more SCROLL_TIME, it will not only retrieve more albums, but also increasingly more obscure releases!


### DOWNLOADER MODE ###
1- Just paste URLs of the albums you wish to download. Some examples of good URLs are:
https://tinymouse.bandcamp.com/album/the-happiest-mouse-alive
https://diplodocus.bandcamp.com/track/grazing-antarctopelta
2- Press the DOWNLOAD button
3- Just wait for the downloads to finish!

* Remember, only one URL per line!
* Tagging of the mp3 is automatic for the artist, track number, track title, and album fields.
* You can set the download path in the config.ini.

---------------------------------------------
				   OPTIONS
---------------------------------------------
AUTOPLAY:
	- If enabled, when the currently playing track ends, a new randonaut search will be automatically start and a new track will be retrieved.
QUANTUM RANDOM:
	- If enabled, random numbers will be 'true-random'. These are generated by the Quantum Random Number Generator provided by the Australian National University.
	- If disabled, or the QRNG site is down, random will fall back to generated by the random python library.
SCROBBLE:
	- This feature is only for users of last.fm
	- If enabled, the track will scrobble at playing the 75% of its length 
	- You need to put your last.fm username and password in the config.ini file, before starting bandonautica.exe

		 KNOW ISSUES AND OTHER NOTES
---------------------------------------------
* In 2021 ANU changed their site. A new key is generated every something days? This needs to be investigated, but for now add your key by hand in the ini file in the ANU_KEY var. (Check your key by sending a request from this page "https://qrng.anu.edu.au/dice-throw/", go to dev tools, and look the string in the requests tab in "dice_nonce_field". Example using Firefox: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bembidiona/bandonautica/master/src/form.png)
* For filtering the random by a tag, it is needed having Chrome installed.
Bandonautica ship with chromedriver version 87 (at the time of writing this). If you encounter problems using this mode, download the correct version for your Chrome installation from here https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads, and add it to the path in the config.ini.
* The first time searching with a specified tag can take some time. But after that is way faster that randonauting in the complete bandcamp site
* Waiting the sites to respond requests can take some time, making the GUI unresponsive. Try to don't fiddle with the GUI when a search or downloads is in progress.
* Crashes are expected. Check the log.txt file for a list of the tracks listened and hints of what can be gone wrong.
* English in this file is expected to be bad :)
